# Predicting-Transcranial-Ultrasound-Insertion-Loss-Using-Skull-CT

Transcranial ultrasound (tUS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique with applications in brain disorders. However, ultrasound attenuation induced by the skull significantly affects focal energy transmission. The loss of ultrasound intensity can be quantified by insertion loss (IL). Accurate IL prediction is crucial for optimizing ultrasound delivery. Conventional grid-based numerical methods for IL prediction are computationally expensive and highly sensitive to parameter variations. To address these challenges, we hypothesized that skull structural features are inherently correlated with IL and can be effectively captured through deep learning method. In this study, we conducted transmission experiments on 20 human skull specimens to measure IL at three frequencies of 220kHz, 650kHz, and 1000kHz. Then we trained a modified dual-path Inception-based neural network (mDPI-Net) for IL prediction based on skull computed tomography (CT) scan. Comparison study showed that mDPI-Net outperforms other advanced deep architectures and finite difference method (FDM) based simulations, achieving a lower Mean Absolute Error (2.467 dB vs. 3.296 dB) with significantly higher computation efficiency (15 min/sample vs. 0.5 s/sample). The proposed approach demonstrated that the skull CT scan could inherently encode structural information relevant to IL. Under a well-fixed experimental setup, deep learning has the potential to enable real-time or rapid pre-operative IL predictions, and achieve more precise dose control in tUS applications such as neuromodulation, transcranial drug delivery, and non-invasive brain stimulation.
